# **Theory of Mind Influences**
*Study Summary* 
- This project is motivated by prior research exploring how Theory of Mind performance in early childhood is correlated to executive functioning and later achievement. It is also motivated by the previous literature focusing on the child themselves by expanding the scope to investigate external inputs in the child's Zip Code and Social Network. This project is in pursuit of Honors distinction in my B.A. in Psychology.
- This study includes behavioral measures, surveys, and government data.
- The dataset includes data based on Scaling Theory of Mind (Wellman & Liu, 2004), parent surveys based on the Child's Social Understanding Scale, the child's age, their zip code's crime and language statistics, and the number of people the child interacts with regularly.


*Dataset*
- Dependent variable: Theory of Mind Performance
- Independent variable: age (months), Zip Code crime rate and language diversity (decimal), social network size (#), school enrollment (1=yes, 0=no)
